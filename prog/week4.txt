Programming Week 4 Lab
Partner: Amanda Collins, collama04

I started homework 2, but didn't finish it. Having trouble finding relevant examples
on how to do it. I think I might start doing iJava just in case I can't figure out
how to do the homeworks. Then I will do both iJava and the homeworks.

Amanda has been working on iJava and her next goal is to complete another chapter
in iJava.

Week 4 Goal: Finish Homework 2 & 3. Start iJava (just in case)
