Programming Week 5 Lab
Partner: Brieanna Benson, benbri03

I mostly finished homework 2, but I decided to start with iJava instead and stick with it
for the rest of the quarter. The homeworks are much harder for me this quarter for some reason
compared to all of the homeworks from the last two quarters. I feel like there hasn't been a lot
of guidance with the homework assignments this quarter, and no similar examples.
I still want to do the homeworks, but they take so much more time than normal this quarter. So,
for now, I'll finish iJava.

Brieanna said that she completed homework 2 and 3 with some recluctance. She said that she had
to research Linked Lists online since we didn't learn about it in class, and she didn't have
any fun doing it!

Week 5 Goal: Complete chapters 3,4,5 in iJava.
