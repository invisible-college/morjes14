Architecture HW 5

1.
SIMD: Same Instruction, Multiple Data. Doing the same operation
independently to several different pieces of data. Parallel operations.

MIMD: Multiple Instruction Multiple Data. While one pipelining is 
preforming one instruction on a piece of data, another pipeline can be
doing an entirely different operation on entirely different data.

GPU's are SIMD since they have widely taken over the tasks of the CPU.
A lot of tasks in 3D graphics are idependent from each other, so they
are parallelized. 

2.
Spatial locality states that two instructions reference contiguous memory
 locations. For example, references to a[i]. a[0] and a[1] will be next to 
 each other in memory.

Temporal locality states that two instructions reference the same location 
within a relatively short timeframe. For example, a[i] is referenced frequently, 
with instructions like a[i] = a[i] * 2 and a[i] = a[i] * 3 being executed 
very close together.
