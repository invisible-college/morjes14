1.	The LED pins are connected together and wired to form a common pin. 
** on the Arduino**
	
2.	The latch pin is used to tell the shift register when it should turn its outputs on and
	off according to the bits that were sent to it - i.e., latching them into place.

3.	Shared memory is memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs with 
	an intent to provide communication among them or avoid redundant copies. 
	Distributed memory refers to a multiple-processor computer system in which each processor
	has its own private memory. 
	
4.	Segment registers allow the CPU to access memory outside of 64 KB to specify where the
	code, stack and data 64 KB segments are positioned within 1 MB of memory.

5.	Maybe have each core take a quarter of the numbers to compute..?

6.	Subtract 4 from SP (Stack Pointer)

7.	

8.	In terms of threads in Java, Synchronized is all about different threads reading and
	writing to the same variables, objects and resources. Synchronized methods enable a 
	simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency errors: if 
	an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's 
	variables are done through synchronized methods.
	
9.	Cache Coherence is the consistency of shared resource data that ends up stored in 
	multiple local caches.
