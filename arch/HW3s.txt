Chapter 6
1.	The register is decremented by the appropiate amount, usually 2. This pushes the top of
the stack two bytes closer to the rest of the program. The value to be pushed is stored
in these new two bytes.

The register that contains the stack pointer is usually set by the programmer to one
or more of the registers (normally r1).

2.	A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: 
If A is a parent node of B then the key of node A is ordered with respect to the key 
of node B with the same ordering applying across the heap.

Heaps are implemented in an array and don't need pointers between elements.

3.	8 general purpose registers: AX BX CX DX
								 SI DI BP SP

4. 	The Pentium has 8 general purpose registers, but it also has more registers. 
The 8 general purpose registers have expanded to hold 32-bit quantities and received
new names. They are now: EAX EBX ECX EDX
						 ESI EDI EBP ESP
						 
5.	IRQ or INT

6.	objdump -Dslx file

7.	In the Greet array, where everything can be accessed or changed from anywhere in
	the program.
	
8.	Most of the Pentium instruction set is inherited directly from the 8088. The only
major change is that the mnemonics have been updated to reflect the possibility of using
the extended 32-bit registers; the instruction 
							ADD EAX, EBX ; ADD 32-bit register to 32-bit register
							
9.	Because that is the standard method of reading and writing in Western culture.

10.	The #define creates a macro, which is the association of an identifier or 
parameterized identifier with a token string. After the macro is defined, the compiler 
can substitute the token string for each occurrence of the identifier in the source 
file.
