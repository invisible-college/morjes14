Arch HW 5s - Midterm Rewrite

1. 	Harvard Architecture has different physical storage banks available for 
	transferring instructions. Von Neumann uses four organs: ALU, System Memory, 
	Control Unit, and Peripherals. No organ in Harvard Architecture. Many micro 
	controllers, including the Arduino Atmel Mega, are Harvard Architecture.
	
2.	Virtual memory acts like a set of tables pointing to a physical space in 
	memory.  An entire table of addresses that store data, could point to one 
	address in hardware memory.  2^18 bytes.

3.	Normally the value of an address in this code would access the value of 
	the address and place it back into it.  But by specifically stating in []'s
	only the value will be copied and used in a general register for the operation.
	MOV AX, 220  = move 220 into AX

4.	GRRG ---Sensor EW---> YRRY ---Timer---> RGGR ---Sensor NS---> RYYR ---Timer---
    	^--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	 
	TNEWS States: RGRRG, RYRRY, RRGGR, RRYYR, YGRRR, YYRRR, YRRRR, GGRRR, GYRRR, GRRRR
	10 states

7. 	2^48 addresses with 6 byte word sizes can create 2^48 * 2^2 * 2^1 = 2^51 bytes

8.	0x41

9.	Maybe it's where the bytes are partitioned out or divided up before adding them to
	something. Partition add splits the larger word size into smaller word sizes in bytes
	(32 bit = 4 8 bit ops) so the operation can be done faster.
	0x00|0x00|0x00|0x00 instead of 0x00000000

10. 	0.0020 seconds/0.0025 seconds = 80 percent of the time it took the one processer.
	Two processors is 20 percent more efficient than one, in this case.

11	 The first loop is more effective because the search goes like this.  
	A[i] means, in the array of arrays, you pick one array to iterate over and search 
	through for each [j], or element of the array, inside the main array.  The other way 
	requires you to look up both i and j again to access it while the first one grabs i once, 
	and then searches j only.
