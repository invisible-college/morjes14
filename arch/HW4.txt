Architecture HW 4

1.
Registers are essentially free and programmers can have and use as many as 
they like. Local variables are the same in that programmers can use as many
as they like.

2.
Local variables are easily changed. 
Local variables only store bit patterns.

3.
A stack is a collection of number or data object with similar properties.
And only the top element is available for processing.

4.
5, 7, null

5.
Extended address space, address space, and capacity increase.
Would let programmers do operations involving numbers quadrillions more
quickly.

6.
Fetch, Dispatch, Execute, Complete/Writeback

7.
With the RISC, at every step the instruction to move a particular byte
would have to be fetched and interpreted. The overall fetch cycle may
run faster, but it would need to use lots of instructions to do so. A 
CISC could do the same in a single machine instruction.

8.
A data structure consisting of groups of nodes which together represent
a sequence. Each node is composed of a data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. Linked Lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of
elements from any position in the sequence.

9.
Can provide computers with access to greater amounts of memory more quickly
and securely.
Don't have to use up physical memory.
