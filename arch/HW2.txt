Architecture HW 2

2.
Infix: (7+1)*(8-3)
Postfix: 7 1 + 8 3 - *

4.
The fetch-execute cycle is more complex on a RISC computer because the chip might 
have to more each byte or word into the CPU from memory, and then back into memory. 

6.
Typed Calculations Advantages: Greater security,

Typed Calculations Disadvantages: More tricky to use, almost every combination of type 
and operation needs a special opcode and mnemonic. 

7.
The instruction 'cadd', doesn't exist because you can't add chars together in the same way 
as adding ints together with 'iadd'. There is no such thing as adding chars together.

8.
bipush -7
ldc -7
ldc2 -7
sipush -300
sipush -300.0

9.
Shift operations can be used to move bits around in a number to make it a new number.
So you could possibly shift the bits of a number around to add 8 to it.

10.
Maybe from shift operations or from stack manipulation operations such as the pop
operation. 

11.
add, sub, mul, and div all work on int, float, and long.

12.
The number divided by is stored as the second element.

14.
a b + c + d + e + e /
