1.	Virtual memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both 
	hardware and software. It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual 
	addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory.

2.	A page table is the data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer 
	operating system to store the mapping between virtual addresses and physical addresses. 

3.	A page fault is a trap to the software raised by the hardware when a program accesses
	a page that is mapped in the virtual address space, but not loaded in physical memory.

4.	32-bits
