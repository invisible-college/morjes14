1.	What is virtual memory and why is it useful?

2.	What is a page table?

3.	What is a page fault?

4.	How many bits are used for an address on a Pentium? Explain the possibilities

5.	Suppose you use an MMX add for the following two registers, and assume that [unsigned] 
	bytes wrap around, i.e.
	  255 + 1 = 0
	
	Show the result for a byte partitioned add for the following two registers:
	  | 128 |  15 |  22 |  240 |
	+ | 180 |   6 |  33 |  128 |
	
	What would these two registers look like in hexadecimal? 

	What would the result look like in hexadecimal? You can write a program to compute this.

6.	What would a normal add result in, if these were treated as unsigned 32-bit quantities 
that were being added?
