Chapter 9
1.	First, they are found in embedded systems. Second, they are smaller, less capable.
	Third, they are usually single-chip gadgets.

3.	

4.	No, the Atmel AVR is an example of the Harvard Architecture where different physical
	storage banks are available for transferring machine instructions and data.

5.	RAM is Random Access Memory that can be accessed at any time, in any order and from any
	physical location. It is volatile.
	ROM is Read-only Memory that can not be easily altered or reprogrammed. ROM is lost when
	the power is turned off. It is non-volatile.
	
6.	SRAM costs more because it is more efficient. It doesn't require refresh cycles and it 
	can be accessed more quickly. It's faster and consumes less power than DRAM.

7.	Read-only bank: for program code  
	Read/Write bank: for program variables
	Long term storage: for long term storage of program data
	
8.	Watchdog timer prevents the system from locking up.

9.	"Memory-mapped I/O" performs input/output between the CPU and peripheral devices.

10.	 Uses EEPROM. UART interacts with the CPU through four registers.

11.	Change the pattern in which the lights flash.

12.	EPROM: Erasable Programmable ROM, semiconductor-based reusable fuse at each memory
	element.
	EEPROM: Electronically Erasable Programmable ROM, uses a localized electrical field
	to "erase" each memory cell instead of erasing the entire chip.
	
13.	UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter, builtin peripherial for large
	scale data transmission/reception.
	
14.	An interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an
	event that needs immediate attention.
